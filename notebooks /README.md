# ASE tutorials - Molecular Dynamics 
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/UCL-DDMD/ASE-Tutorials-/main?urlpath=lab)


In these tutorials, we'll run some molecular dynamics (MD) simulation on bulk metals. 

## Exercise 1: 

In this example, you'll see a demonstration of running NVE MD simulations on Cu. You will then need to run the example 
yourself for FCC Al, Cu, Au, Ni, Ag, Pt and Pd. You can find the lattice constant (a) for each one in a table below:



| Metal     | Unit Cell | Lattice constant (Ã…) |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------|
| Aluminum  | FCC       | 4.046                |
| Copper    | FCC       | 3.597                |
| Gold      | FCC       | 4.065                |
| Nickel    | FCC       | 3.499                |
| Silver    | FCC       | 4.079                |
| Platinum  | FCC       | 3.912                |
| Palladium | FCC       | 3.859                |


Some questions to think about:

1) The lattice constants after the geometry optimisations are different to the experiment. Why? 
2) How could I improve the accuracy of my calculation? 




## Exericse 2: 

Post-processing is an important step after performing any calculation (especially MD). 
Here you'll extract the scientifically relevant information from your simulation and analyse your data. 

Here you'll see a plot of the 2D potential energy surface of Cu-Cu bond length from the MD trajectory. 
You'll also see a scatter plot of the Cu-Cu bonds and a heatmap. 
Try plotting these for the other metal systems you ran simulations on in Exercise 1. 

Here are some questions to think about: 

1) What do the different contours in the 2D PES correspond to? What does this tell you about the Cu-Cu bonds?
2) Similarly, what information can you deduce from the scatter plot? And what does this say about the nature of Cu-Cu bonds?

Try increasing the number of MD steps for one of your system by a factor of 10 (This will take some time). 

4) How does the scatter plot change? 
5) What patterns do you see and what does this correspond to? 
6) Would you expect this to look different if you use a different physical theory?
